Longest Consecutive Sequence

ALGORITHM

Since O(n) is required

We use hash to search

1.
hash[each] = long_around

cons:
each-1 and each+1 are waiting for update

not only O(n)

2.
python中的set也是hash

hash[each] = True

when do search, we only consider the start number i.e. hash[each-1] = False
then we only need to update the numbers after once
