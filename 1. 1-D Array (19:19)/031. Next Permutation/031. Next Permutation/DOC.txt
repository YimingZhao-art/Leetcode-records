findNext Permutation

ALGORITHM:

find the fix part and movable part

12453 -> 12534

fix part is 12

we know the movable part is in descending order

--Any series in Desc order is not used for nextPerm, it is last Perm, so

1. find the longest Desc from the last
Therefore, there must be a dropPoint
12 4 53
drop is 4

2. reverse the movable part
12 4 35

3. find the first element in movable that is larger than dropPoint, then swap
12 5 34

NOTE:
if we use:
num = num[:dropPoint+1] + movable
the id(num) will change
the change is not in num

repeat elements:
the repeat elements will be the one we want to exchange in movable and fixed
so we need to search in movable not from the start.
