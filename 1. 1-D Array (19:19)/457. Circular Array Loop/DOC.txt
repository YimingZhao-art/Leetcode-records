Circular Array Loop

ALGORITHM

1.
from each unvisited point(All visited points no need to revisit)
use DFS

mark in the array by +-(start index+1)*1000
Because one point can be placed in two loops(All visited points no need to revisit)

NOTE: loop need to use the same direction

next = (curr + tag*(abs(nums[curr])%1000))%L
for example, -1001 % 1000 -> 999, so we need to use abs(-1001)%1000, but don't forget the direction, we use tag


2.
two pointers
